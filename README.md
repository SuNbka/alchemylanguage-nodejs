# AlchemyLanguage Demo

[AlchemyLanguage][service_url] is a collection of APIs that offer text analysis through natural language processing. The AlchemyLanguage APIs can analyze text and help you to understand its sentiment, keywords, entities, high-level concepts and more.

The service has been deprecated as of April 7, 2017 and will remain supported till Mar 7, 2018. Use the Watson Natural Language Understanding service to tap into the same powerful text analytics and natural language processing capabilities you've come to know and love from AlchemyAPI.
